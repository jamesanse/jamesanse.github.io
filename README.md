### My name is James and after getting dianosed with vertebral artery dissection (VAD) at age 35, I have done a ton of research about this rare condition. This web site serves as a dumping ground of what I have learned so far. They are NOT medical advice.

### What is VAD/CAD

Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) occurs when there is a tear or damage to the inner lining of one of the vertebral arteries, which are major blood vessels that run along the neck and supply blood to the brain. This tear allows blood to enter the wall of the artery, separating its layers, which may lead to complications such as reduced blood flow, blood clots, or, in severe cases, stroke. 

Similarly, a Carotid artery dissection is when the inner lining of the carotid arteries get damaged.

### How is VAD/CAD diagnosed?

Diagnosis typically involves imaging studies

- Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA, or MRI with dye).
- Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA, or CT with dye)
- Doppler Ultrasound (rarely used)
- Catheter Angiogram - this is an invasive method which a catheter with camera is inserted into the artery to get an 100% accurate view of the blood vessel.

### Treatment

Typically VAD/CAD injuries can heal on its own over time. While healing is taking place, doctors may prescribe antiplatelet drug and/or anticoalgulant drugs. These drugs reduces the likelihood of a stroke and they are typically known as "blood thinners". Depending on the severity of the tear and medical providers's preference.

Antiplatelet | Anticoagulant
----| ---
Aspirin ((Acetylsalicylic Acid) | Warfarin (Coumadin)
Clopidogrel (Plavix) | Heparin
Ticagrelor (Brilinta)  |  Eliquis (Apixaban)
Prasugrel (Effient) | Pradaxa (Dabigatran)
 n/a | Xarelto (Rivaroxaban) 

Doctor may prescribe one or more of the drugs listed above. However, please keep in mind, more does not always mean better. These drugs inhibits the body's ability to form blood clot, which does introduce the risk of bleeding.

Sometimes doctors may decide to perform surgery on the artery if the damage is severe and/or multiple dissections are found.

### Common questions

 #### Will I get a stroke after starting my antiplatelet or anticoalgulant therapy?
   According to this [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(15)70018-9/fulltext), 250 VAD/CAD patients received either antiplatelet or anticoalgulant drugs soon __after__ the diagnosis. After 3 month, only 4 patients had a stroke and no one had died.

 #### I believe I may have VAD/CAD but my doctor refuse to give me a CTA scan. What should I do?
   I have seen so many people get misdiagnosed because VAD/CAD is relatively rare. Please be your own advocate, tell your doctor about VAD/CAD and be assertive in demanding a medical scan. Your health is worth more than anything in this world. Pay out of pocket if you must. Even if nothing is found in the scan, the peace of mind is worth it.

#### Is it common to develop anxiety after VAD/CAD.
Yes, VAD/CAD is a life-altering experience. It is not uncommon for patients to start developing anxiety/depression. If you develop anxious thoughts, ask your doctor about CBT and/or SSRI medications.
